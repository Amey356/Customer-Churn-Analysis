# Customer-Churn-Analysis
This project conducts a multi-level customer churn analysis using Excel. Level 1 focuses on single-column insights, Level 2 examines two-column relationships with churn as target, and Level 3 uncovers multi-columns patterns. Each level integrates interpretations and visualizations to identify churn, enabling strategic decision-making for retention.
